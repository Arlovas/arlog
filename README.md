# Arlog

My take on reliving old times where content was created by humans, driven by the will to create, not just by the desire for fame or money.

Small disclaimer, do what you want, but try to be proud of yourself in the process. Wanna create content only using AI and without soul? Be my guest xd

## NextJS 

Main goal is to have a blog, write things I like and dislike. And this will also make me learn new things. Let's see where we land. 

I'm using the NextJs blog template, and will be creating on top of it. To see more of the original code please visit the link below:

**GIT** -> https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter

**DEMO** -> [https://next-blog-starter.vercel.app/](https://next-blog-starter.vercel.app/)


## Create your own

Give the world to your thought (at least to some of if). Start your own blog / diary. 

<br>

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example blog-starter blog-starter-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example blog-starter blog-starter-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example blog-starter blog-starter-app
```

Your blog should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)! If it doesn't work, post on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions).
